Easy Recovery

A simple but powerful tool for backup your files.

Using a JSON backup catalog, creates a copy of all files into a destination directory (maybe a different drive).
During copy, creates an hash of the oringal file and the same hash of the copied file.
Supports file name pattern exclusion during copy.

The process is logged into an Microsoft Excel registry.
